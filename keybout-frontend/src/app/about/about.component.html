  <h4>Origins</h4>

  <p>Keybout started in 2015 as a WebSocket (an advanced communication protocol over the Internet) sample project
    then evolved to a simple game.</p>

  <p>The original implementation was based on: JavaScript, WebSocket, HTML, Bootstrap, Java EE 7, WildFly, Maven</p>

  <h4>Rewrite</h4>

  <p>In 2019, to learn Angular and Kotlin, I started a full rewrite of the application.</p>

  <p>This second version is based on: Angular, SockJS, HTML, Bootstrap, Spring Boot, Kotlin, Maven</p>
