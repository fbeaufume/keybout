  <h4>Game creation</h4>

  <h5>Mode</h5>
  <p>The supported game modes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In <span class="text-primary">capture</span> games the players compete for the words, the first player that
      typed a word wins it. The round winner is the player who caught the most words before the round expires.
    </li>
    <li>In <span class="text-primary">race</span> games the same list of words is duplicated for each player. The round
      winner is the player who caught all his words the fastest, or the most words before the round expires.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The first player who wins 2 rounds wins the game.</p>

  <h5>Style</h5>
  <p>An effect used to display the words:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="text-primary">Regular</span> displays the word as is, e.g.
      <button class="btn btn-primary">DANCER</button>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="text-primary">Hidden</span> hides one or more letters (depends on the word length), e.g.
      <button class="btn btn-primary">D_NCER</button>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="text-primary">Anagram</span> shuffles the letters, e.g.
      <button class="btn btn-primary">ADCENR</button>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="text-primary">Calculus</span> does not display a word but a mathematical operation, e.g.
      <button class="btn btn-primary">27 + 15</button>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Language</h5>
  <p>The language of the generated words.</p>

  <h5>Difficulty</h5>
  <p>For regular and anagram styles, higher difficulties use longer words.
    For hidden style higher difficulties use a higher hidden-to-visible letters ratio.</p>

  <h4>Game play</h4>

  <p>When typing the words, the case does not matter, you can use write lowercase.</p>
  <p>Using the <b>Space bar</b> clears the input.</p>
  <p>Game rounds have an expiration, i.e. after a while the remaining words are not available anymore and the scores are
    accessible.</p>

  <h4>Scores</h4>

  <p>At the end of a round, the round scores and game scores are displayed.</p>
  <p>The round scores show the number of caught words and the type speed in words per minute.</p>
  <p>The game scores show the number of rounds won and the best type speed so far.</p>
  <p>The scores also show some awards. They are honorific and give no benefit. The awards are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="text-primary">First</span> for the player who caught the first word of the round.</li>
    <li><span class="text-primary">Longest</span> for the player who first caught the longest word,
      only in word based styles.
    </li>
    <li><span class="text-primary">Last</span> for the player who caught the last word of the round,
      only in capture mode.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Misc</h4>

  <p>The <b>Enter</b> key can be used as a shortcut for various user actions (connect to the server, view scores, start next round, etc).</p>
